## Learning objectives

If you are a **software developer**, new to blockchain development and donâ€™t know where to start, then this workshop is for you.

On the other hand, if you are already experienced in blockchain development, take the workshop to start discovering **NEM blockchain**. You will be surprised by how developer-friendly NEM actually is.

In this workshop, you are going to work with a real use case: blockchain technology applied to **supply chain**. Discover NEM built-in features step by step, using them in an already existent application.
