In this example, a manufacturer that produces perishable goods has a process to check if the products are safe for consumption.

Once the product has been produced, it requires to be stored in a warehouse. Then, an operator registers the product in the company's system.

After that, the operator performs some tests to determine whether the product is safe for consumption or not, storing the results obtained.

## Finding the value proposition - Why?

We all realise the potential of the blockchain, but which is the exact value proposition to use blockchain in this use case?

Traceability and transparency are vital in logistics. Perishable products are tracked through all the supply chain to decide if the goods can be sold to the consumers.

Blockchain will be used to:

a) Identify each product uniquely. 

b) Keep track of the state of the product.

c) Ensure that certain conditions and procedures have been followed.

d) Certify that only allowed actors can execute specific processes.
