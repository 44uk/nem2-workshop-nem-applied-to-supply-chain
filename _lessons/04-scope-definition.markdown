## What?

NEM is a **flexible blockchain** technology.  Instead of uploading all the application logic into the blockchain, you use specific tested features through API calls for transfer and storage of value, authorisation, traceability and authentication.

The rest of the code remains **off-chain**. This reduces the inherent **immutability risk**, as you could change the process, if necessary, after receiving feedback from the users, or because of a new unexpected functionality.

We will start with a very simple  **minimum viable product**. Then, as the workshop continues, we will be adding some more complexity.

1) As a warehouse operator, I want to register a product.

2) As a warehouse operator, I want to register if a product is safe for consumption.
